5. **build-docker** - Docker image build
   - Multi-platform build with buildx
   - Layer caching (GitHub Actions cache)
   - Image inspection
   - Container startup test
   
6. **smoke-test** - End-to-end validation
   - Health endpoint test (HTTP 200, JSON validation)
   - Main application endpoint test
   - Config.json endpoint test
   - Static file serving test
   - Gzip compression verification
   - Proxy endpoint basic test
   - Server log error checking
   
7. **security-scan** - Security validation

   - Snyk vulnerability scanning
   
8. **summary** - Pipeline results
   - Overall status display
   - Critical check validation
   - Pipeline failure detection

#### Pipeline Features

- **Parallel Execution**: Jobs run concurrently when possible
- **Dependency Management**: Jobs wait for prerequisites
- **Artifact Caching**: npm and Docker layer caching for speed
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed output for debugging
- **Always Cleanup**: Containers cleaned up even on failure
- **Multiple Triggers**: Push, PR, and manual dispatch

#### Smoke Test Details

The smoke test job provides comprehensive validation:

```bash
✓ Health endpoint returns 200 with {"status": "ok"}
✓ Main application returns 200 and serves index.html
✓ Config.json returns valid JSON
✓ Static files are served correctly
✓ Gzip compression is enabled
✓ Proxy endpoint is responding
✓ No errors in server logs
```

## Benefits for Junior Developers

### README Improvements

1. **Self-Service Learning**: Junior devs can onboard independently
2. **Clear Prerequisites**: Know exactly what to install
3. **Step-by-Step Workflows**: No guessing about next steps
4. **Architecture Understanding**: Learn the "why" not just "what"
5. **Best Practices**: Learn professional development standards
6. **Testing Guidance**: Understand how to test their changes

### CI/CD Pipeline Benefits

1. **Automated Validation**: Catches errors before merge
2. **Fast Feedback**: Know within minutes if changes work
3. **Learning Tool**: See what checks professional projects run
4. **Confidence Building**: Green checks = code is ready
5. **Documentation by Example**: Pipeline shows testing best practices

## Usage

### For Developers

1. **Read the README**: Start to finish for complete understanding
2. **Follow Quick Start**: Get up and running in <10 minutes
3. **Reference as Needed**: Use sections as a reference guide
4. **Contribute**: Follow contributing guidelines for PRs

### For CI/CD

The pipeline runs automatically on:
- Push to `master`, `main`, or `develop` branches
- Pull requests to these branches
- Manual trigger via GitHub Actions UI

**Manual Trigger:**
1. Go to Actions tab in GitHub
2. Select "CI/CD Pipeline"
3. Click "Run workflow"

## Testing the Changes Locally

### Test README Clarity

Ask a junior developer to:
1. Clone the repo
2. Follow README instructions
3. Provide feedback on clarity

### Test CI/CD Pipeline

**Run equivalent commands locally:**

```bash
# Lint
npm run lint
npx tsc --noEmit

# Test
npm test -- --coverage --watchAll=false

# Build Angular
npm run build-prod
ls -la dist/xregistry-viewer/

# Build Server
node --check server.js

# Build Docker
docker build -t xregistry-viewer:test .
docker run -d --name xregistry-test -p 4000:4000 xregistry-viewer:test

# Smoke Tests
curl http://localhost:4000/health
curl http://localhost:4000/
curl http://localhost:4000/config.json

# Cleanup
docker stop xregistry-test
docker rm xregistry-test
```

## Files Changed
